.SH NAME
pyhesiodfs \- PythonFUSE-based automounter for /mit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pyhesiodfs [
.I options
.B ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pyhesiodfs
uses the Python FUSE API to create a FUSE ("Filesystem in Userspace")
filesystem mounted on /mit, which automatically looks up locker names
in Hesiod and creates the necessary symlinks to the path in AFS.  It
is the user's responsibility to obtain the necessary AFS tokens, though
this is usually done at login time by PAM.

.SH OPTIONS
Most options are passed directly to the Python FUSE option parser.
Consult that documentation for the appropriate options.  

On Debathena, it is typically invoked as:
.B pyhesiodfs -f /mit -o nonempty

.SH CONFIGURATION
There is an optional config file, with inline documentation, installed
at wherever your distribution installs documentation (probably
/usr/share/doc).  Go read it.
